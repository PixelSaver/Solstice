<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Overall
Siege W13. Unlucky number, but the theme being Winter is amazing. Still, brainstorming was hard. I wasn't able to get 10 hours fully, unfortunately, but Im still proud of what I was able to do. The enemy and the death screen are rushed, but alas. Survive the night!!

Siege W15 Back again because my friend said this was almost peak!! Going to add to the readme what I want to get done

### What even is this?
You're in a cabin, staring out into the winter day. Pick up a few calls, and watch the sun set. It's the winter solstice, and there's a long night ahead. Stay awake, stay alert, and make it past... the Solstice.
* First person controller
* Cabin, gun, forest, and monster models
* Nighttime environment
* Enemies to shoot
* Monster is animated
* Sparks on wherever you hit
* Death once enemies get to your window

### What do I take out of this?
Don't procrastinate... I had hours which I wasted, and now Ive an unfinished game. Dang.

### Screenshots
They’re fairly large, so I’ve tucked them into expandable sections:

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project.

* Godot 4.5.1

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>



### Play 

If you'd like to build it yourself, I used Godot 4.5. I do have a pre-built web version available [here on my itch](https://pixelsaver.itch.io/just-u-and-i), but if you still insist on building this unoptimized mess, go ahead.

1. Install Godot 4.5
2. Download and unzip the code
3. Open the file with Godot project manager
4. Go to Project > Export, add whichever platform you're on (MacOS, Windows) and then click export.
5. You're good to go!

#### Tutorial
If you're stuck, I have left a list of hints below to help you out :)
